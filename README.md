# gitweb-gentoo-org-repo-proj-prefix
This is a delayed fork of https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/prefix.git 

Delayed means that it may be automated or non automated, but not done by any Gentoo developper.

This is intended to contain a chain of Pull Requests for Gentoo, to be able to
make endrood.sf.net work. This is about adapting Gentoo Prefix (user install of
Gentoo Linux, the most native possible) to environments without /bin/sh, /tmp
or /usr/bin/env.
